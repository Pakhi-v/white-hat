  <h3>Covid-19 Vaccines</h3>
  <h2>Importance of COVID-19 vaccines.</h2>
  <p>As world is in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, countries across the globe are racing to develop and deploy safe and effective vaccines. Vaccines are a critical new tool in the battle against COVID-19 and it is safe to say that safe and effective vaccines are the gamechangers.

    But, why do we need vaccination?
    
     The vaccine reduces your risk of infection.
     The vaccine protects against severe illness.
     The vaccine (eventually) will help us ditch the masks.
     The vaccine will help you reconnect with friends and family.
    India currently has two vaccines – homegrown Covaxin and Serum Institute of India’s Covishield. Earlier this month, Russia's Sputnik V was also given emergency use authorisation by India's drug regulator.</p>
